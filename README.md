# PlayerController.cs
Nothing special, just my player controller I use a basement for my 2D platformer. Features things like a custom gravity and a jump you can perfom if you fall of a edge

_"The player can jump when he is in the green area. The larger green area on the right makes it easier to jump across platforms (thatâ€™s a good thing)."_ **Diorgo Jonkers at Dev.Mag**

# Multiline.cs
Just a script with a very large multiline string which you can use as notepad
